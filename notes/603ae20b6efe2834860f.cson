  # Double Net Training Issues
  
  Started training my network with SqueezeNet computing the metadata from two input images, and then feeding this data to a pretrained model of Z2Color in evaluate mode. The goal was to have SqueezeNet able to infer metadata completely. Unfortuantely I ran into a training error where each epoch has extremely similar validation error and the squeeze net is not learning anything.

  ```
  
  It's probably some error in the modified training code. So I'm going to sit down and compare my new training code to the old one line by line to see if I messed anything up.

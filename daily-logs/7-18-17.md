## Stopping Behavior
Ran the car and didn't experience any stopping behavior, Karl says it may be due to the calibration of my car. I'll try it again with the motor trim tuned so that it takes a lot of motion to start moving the car and then see what the car does when driving.

## Training Code
Need to do a rewrite of the main training loop to account for using data moments as a metric rather than time, similar to my old training code. Some basic thoughts:

- Need to validate on full validation dataset after each epoch of training
- Option to run validation intermittently after every N data points during training.
- Option to just validate a network without any training.

    #### Psuedocode
    ```python
    while True:
        while not train_epoch_complete:
            ctr++
            if ctr > n:
                val_ctr = val_loss = 0
                while val_ctr < epsilon:
                    validate()
                print val_loss

            train()

            if print_timer.check():
                display()
        while not val_epoch_complete:
            validate()

        save('epoch N val_loss save')
    ```

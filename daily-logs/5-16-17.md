## Training Modifications

I modified network training to match changed inference code and train Z2Color Batchnorm it's training about 2-3x faster than normal. Was a bit rushed this morning before going out to school so don't have the exact performance specs but I can see pretty clearly that the network is training at a much more desirable speed. I believe two epochs can be done by the time I get home from schoo (6.5 hours from now)

## Inference

Pretty late last night I cleaned up the inference code and pushed out my changes to the repository. These seem to be all good.

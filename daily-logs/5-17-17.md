## TX2 Install Script

Finished the [TX2 install script](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sauhaardac/9d7a82c23e4b283a1e79009903095655/raw/2f2973b6fe1c2c9ff436ac74e4874165809f881f/setup_tx2.sh). It looks pretty good and I'm fairly sure it should work with maybe a couple hiccups hen tried out. Trying it out is the hard part. I only have 1 TX2 and I don't want to reflash it and lose my progress if I get stuck on reinstallation. That would really suck. I could:

1. Visit Berkeley and test the script on a Jetson TX2 there (wouldn't be too bad since I could also meet with Kurt's SqueezeNet group while I'm there)
2. Have someone in Berkeley flash the Jetson TX2 with Jetpack 3.0 and ssh the Jetson into bdd3. I can access the flashed Jetson remotely from the ssh tunnel created.
3. Get the Jetson TX2 shipped to San Diego from Berkeley
4. Reflash the working Jetson TX2 (Last resort - wouldn't like to get rid of working example)

- [x] Email Karl with the above info, and get his advice on what route I should take for testing the script.

## SqueezeNet 

Got an email from the SqueezeNet team looking to meet with them. Will be a good opportunity because I have a lot of interesting ideas and questions to ask them. I should definitely meet with them in person eventually but I think Skype/BlueJeans meetings should suffice for now.

- [ ] Compile a list of ideas and questions for SqueezeNet group

**Skype/BlueJeans Meeting with SqueezeNet People on Monday 5/22**

- Did some sys admin tasks like changing passwords and setting up new users on BDD3 machine (wow there are a lot of users! we really need to get new machines setup ASAP)

## Karl's Training Rewrite
- I looked through Karl's training rewrite a third time today, and everything looks good, hopefully I'm not missing anything, though it is incredibly hard to read is code given how far he strays from standard pythonic style.

## Metadata Inference
- [ ]  I want to try out my metadata inference network on the car. Haven't yet gotten a chance to implement that yet.
- [ ] First should try some experiments with the actual networks I have trained (Look at the metadata inferred vs. the ground truth metadata)

## Stopping Behavior
- [ ] Run a validation dataset, on each epoch of a trained SqueezeNet model, and graph the standard deviation of the motor values. I wrote a [PyTorch forums post](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/calculate-standard-deviation-of-output-of-network-over-many-samples/4706) about the best way to do this. If this shows that the stopping behavior builds up over epochs as we have seen, this is importaint information for our paper.

## SqueezeNet Meeting
- Finished coming up with topics for meeting with SqueezeNet colleagues.
- Came up with awesome idea for dual network metadata inference:
	> We can run the drive net multiple times with the metadata from a past output of SqueezeNet while SqueezeNet is running, and in the meantime the drive network should be capable of driving for short periods of time without crashing or screwing up the directions. (The netwoks will be run on seperate threads)

## Update
Took a break from work for the past couple days aside from working on a couple of powerpoints for demoing the SqueezeNet presentation due to some tests I have going on at school. But I'm back at it for the SqueezeNet meeting I have on Monday with the people from Kurt's team!

## New Training Methodology

Was talking to Tushar and was taking a look at a bunch of papers and they all train many many more epochs on smaller subsets of images for training. This let's you get many epochs of data to compare networks objectively. Added the following code right after my training to reduce the training and validation sets by 10%.
```python
low_steer_val = low_steer_val[:int(0.1*len(low_steer_val))]
low_steer_train = low_steer_val[:int(0.1*len(low_steer_train))]
high_steer_val = high_steer_val[:int(0.1*len(high_steer_val))]
high_steer_train = high_steer_train[:int(0.1*len(high_steer_train))]
```

## Preparation for SqueezeNet Meeting
I will be training three networks today on the reduced training and validation sets. 

	1. Standard Z2Color Batchnorm
	2. SqueezeNet as replacement for Z2Color
	3. Dual Network SqueezeNet Metadata Inference

For the metadata inference I'll train Z2Color Batchnorm till the 6th epoch take that and use it as the pretrained network for inference. I'll probably have less epochs trained for the dual network modal but it should be understandable)

## Misc.
- It taks 174 seconds for input loading so factor this in to benchmarks of clock speed.

## Priorities

Karl sent me an email about what my priorities should be. I didn't quite realize that this is what he wanted so it's good that he sent this email. For now, I will stop working on the PyTorch metadata inference nets and focus on these priorities.

> Here are the priorities as I see them:
> 
> 1) figure out how to get z2_color running at at least 15Hz on the TX2.
> 
> 2) prepare script/recipe so that we can quickly get up the other TX2's with ROS, ZED, caffe and pyTorch.
> 
> Once pyTorch is working well on the TX2 along with caffe on the same machine I can evaluate if we will use it in place of caffe. If it doesn't perform as well as caffe then we won't use pyTorch unless there is a model that can't be run any other way.

> All other network and hardware tasks are secondary to the above. Please keep me updated.

## Jetson TX2 Optimization

I got an email back from Dustin, but I don't know if any of his suggestions will actually help the conversion between numpy and PyTorch that we were having trouble with. I'm just not clear which part of the process is being optimized if we follow his instructions.

I kow the problem is happening in the conversion from numpy to PyTorch, this area seems to be contributing to most of the slowdowns. I should play around with the conversion to try to get the speed up for camera data processing.

- [x] Play around with numpy to PyTorch conversion to try and optimize it

Got some great results back after changing the numpy to Pytorch conversion code quite a bit so that the input tensor was no longer seperated by colors. Instead the iterative loop went time->l/r->color, this actually reduced the number of conversions neccessary since I can now convert the entire RGB image to Pytorch each time resulting in fewer conversions and a faster run time. This will require me to retrain our networks with this change, however this should also speed up training speeds so I may be able to get a network trained in 1/3 the time.

- [x] Modify network training to match changed inference code and train Z2Color Batchnorm (It had the bst results on the carout of the nets we tried before the demo.) 
- [x] Push changes to inference code after cleaning up the code as describd [here](https://github.com/sauhaardac/Notes/blob/master/daily-logs/5-14-17.md#tx2-code-optiization)
